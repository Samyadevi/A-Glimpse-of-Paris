"DURATION": 45 DAYS

DESCRIPTION:

This project is a fundamental front-end web development exercise, creating a responsive and interactive single-page website dedicated to showcasing Paris as a "favorite place."

Key Aspects of the Code:

HTML (index.html): Provides the foundational structure and content of the webpage, including semantic elements like header, main sections, lists, an image, and a footer. It also links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS (style.css): Handles the entire visual presentation. It applies a light, elegant, and professional color palette, defines typography using Google Fonts, manages layout and spacing, styles interactive elements, and ensures the page is responsive across different screen sizes. It also includes subtle animations and shadows for a refined look.
JavaScript (script.js): Adds interactivity to the page. It manages a clickable button to reveal a "fun fact" about Paris and implements a smooth fade-in animation for content sections as the user scrolls, enhancing the user experience.
Purpose:
This code demonstrates the core interplay between HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity) to build a simple yet visually appealing and dynamic web page. It's ideal for learning and practicing essential web development concepts.
